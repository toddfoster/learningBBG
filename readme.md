# Learning with BBG

## Background
I went to seminary in the '90's. I wasn't very clear on why I was there. But as a lover of languages in a Bible-focused community, my desire was to acquire working knowledge of the principal biblical languages, (Koine) Greek and Hebrew. I took several classes to that end, but did not really achieve my goal. Consistent effort over a long time is the thing, but that has never been my strong point. I always preferred summer & winter terms that offered fewer classes compressed into shorter amounts of time.

I've continued the journey over the years, finding partners and resources to help me along the way.

My seminary classes were based on the J. Gresham Machen's classic (and wonderfully concise/dense) _New Testament Greek for Beginners_ (1923). I bought Bill Mounce's text _Basics of Biblical Greek_ (1993) in 2000, after not having achieved my goals in the classroom. As I understand it, Mounce has something of a Computer Science background himself, as do I. His grammar is all about reducing memorization to the bare bones minimum, and understanding the rules about _how the language works_ instead. This appeals to me.

In 2017 or so I became aware that Mounce had recorded video lectures for _BBG_. A few years later, I bought them: they come on a USB stick (straight from Mounce himself?). But who has time to watch videos in the midst of life and work?

In the meantime, I continue to use my half-remembered Greek as I can, translating a lectionary text most weeks as the beginning of sermon preparation. So I'm far from starting from ground zero. But I am very much in need of reviewing and acquiring some pretty basic information.

## Timeline
Episcopal priests usually get pretty generous vacation: four weeks each year is standard. A burnt-out priest is no help to anyone. A mentor told me he always took his four weeks together. I try to take at least 3.

In 2020, I watched the first several chapters all at once. Then I was able to proceed by covering two chapters per weekday, using weekends to catch up with memorization debt.

I noticed that I will mark things that I need to memorize, but I will not be motivated to memorize them until a few days later when I can see them in their larger context. That helps me have a place to put them and sometimes a strategy for memorizing them.

## Technology
Language acquisition is hard work. Beware: tools can quickly become distractions. Go simple and go familiar so that you're not wasting time on shiny new toys.

- [The textbook: _Basics of Biblical Greek_](https://www.billmounce.com/basicsofbiblicalgreek/grammar) by William D. Mounce. There are _much_ newer editions available. It sounds like Dr. Mounce has learned from years of teaching and tightened up his grammar from its content down to its binding. But my old copy was perfectly adequate to the job.
  - In particular it sounds like Mounce made major changes to how he teaches "Verbal Roots" in chapter 20. That said, I had absolutely no problem with the concept: it made me think of the tri-radical system at the heart of Hebrew verbs.
- [The videos](https://www.billmounce.com/basicsofbiblicalgreek/lectures) where Dr. Mounce lectures through the entire grammar, every chapter. I think he made new ones right after I bought them. But the old ones are fine, too!
  - My aunt once called me "cheap." It's true. And nearly $200 for a USB stick is... substantial. But compared to the cost of a live class at seminary, it's peanuts. And, no, I don't get to ask the teacher questions in real time. And in the older videos, at least, there wasn't much information in the videos that the book had lacked. But hearing him lecture through and place emphasis on certain ideas was both informative and encouraging.
  - For the chapters where I was really struggling, there are [additional resources online for each chapter](https://www.billmounce.com/biblicalgreek1?page=1). My favorite was the "Chapter Overview" video which just showed the slides with a quick lecture through. It was a third way to encounter the material and occasionally gave me just the little extra push I needed.
  - Being cheap, I'm running on older hardware. The USB stick includes full size (HD?) videos and a directory of "Smaller Videos". I play the smaller ones. They still look great. And using [vlc](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) I can play them at 1.50x speed: perfect!
-  [Quizzes for each chapter](https://doxa.billmounce.com/BBG4_quizzes_keys.zip) along with the answers are available online. I finish the quizzes for the previous day's chapters before starting the new ones.
  - There's an older workbook that I bought in 2020 for this attempt on the books. It's OK.
- A spiral notebook for making notes and doing exercises as I go along.
- Worksheets in this repo which I use daily (while actively studying) to refresh and continue fixing information in my brain.
- A [flash card program](http://flashcardsdeluxe.com/Flashcards/). Physical note cards are OK. I have history. But flash cards on my phone are super-convenient and less obvious. [Flash Cards Deluxe](http://flashcardsdeluxe.com/Flashcards/) has been my favorite for years. It has a highly customizable "spaced repetition" mode. You can use multiple choice or traditional flash-card method. You can use images and sounds on the cards. And it's super-simple to create and update text-based cards with a unicode text file uploaded to Dropbox. You'll find several in this repo.
- Scratch paper and a pen: I learn by writing. Sometimes I write repetitively. Sometimes I write to organize information and try out ideas to connect things I'm learning -- which helps me to remember even better than the repetition. Not all of these experiments need to be kept beyond a day or so.
